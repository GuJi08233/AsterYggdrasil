# Getting Started

This page does one thing: run AsterYggdrasil locally and verify that Yggdrasil metadata, accounts, profiles, and texture paths actually work.

If you are preparing a production deployment, run through this page first, then continue to [Docker Deployment](/en/deployment/docker). Starting directly in production is possible, but validating the local flow first saves time.

## Requirements

- Rust stable toolchain.
- SQLite. The default config uses local SQLite and needs no separate database service.
- Bun. Required only for the docs site or the admin frontend.

## 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cargo run
```

The first startup creates runtime files, the SQLite database, and the default static config:

```text
data/config.toml
```

Default address:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Health check endpoints:

```text
GET /health
GET /health/ready
```

## 2. Create the First Admin

AsterYggdrasil includes local authentication and admin APIs. On first run, create the admin through setup:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/setup
```

Normal login, registration, and refresh use:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/login
POST /api/v1/auth/register
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
```

The first created account becomes the administrator. The admin configures public URLs, Yggdrasil policy, signing keys, audit logs, and background tasks.

Admin capabilities include:

- View and update runtime config.
- Execute the Yggdrasil signing key rotation action.
- View audit logs.
- View and retry background tasks.
- Manage users, Minecraft profiles, and textures.

## 3. Verify Yggdrasil Metadata

After startup, request:

```text
GET /api/yggdrasil
GET /api/yggdrasil/
```

The response is authlib-injector metadata and does not use the project API envelope. It should include:

- `meta.serverName`
- `meta.implementationName`
- `meta.implementationVersion`
- `meta.feature.non_email_login`
- `skinDomains`
- `signaturePublickey`

The site homepage `/` returns:

```text
X-Authlib-Injector-API-Location: /api/yggdrasil/
```

Launchers that support ALI can use the site URL and discover the real Yggdrasil API root automatically. When deploying behind a reverse proxy, do not strip this response header.

## 4. Create a Minecraft Profile

After logging into the site account, users can create Minecraft profiles. A profile is the player identity seen by launchers and servers:

```text
POST /api/v1/profiles/minecraft
GET  /api/v1/profiles/minecraft
```

Profile names support controlled renames through the user or administrator APIs. A rename keeps the UUID, texture bindings, and audit trail, then temporarily invalidates bound Yggdrasil tokens so launchers can refresh into the new name. Do not edit names directly in the database.

## 5. Upload and Bind Textures

Current users can upload textures to their wardrobe first, then bind them to a profile:

```text
GET    /api/v1/wardrobe/textures
POST   /api/v1/wardrobe/textures/skin
POST   /api/v1/wardrobe/textures/cape
PUT    /api/v1/profiles/minecraft/{uuid}/textures/skin
PUT    /api/v1/profiles/minecraft/{uuid}/textures/cape
```

Launchers and compatible tools can also use the Yggdrasil texture endpoints to write directly to a profile:


```text
PUT    /api/yggdrasil/api/user/profile/{uuid}/skin
PUT    /api/yggdrasil/api/user/profile/{uuid}/cape
DELETE /api/yggdrasil/api/user/profile/{uuid}/skin
DELETE /api/yggdrasil/api/user/profile/{uuid}/cape
```

Upload requires a Yggdrasil access token. The server validates token state, profile ownership, upload switches, MIME type, PNG dimensions, and then re-encodes the image as a safe PNG.

Public read:

```text
GET /api/yggdrasil/textures/{hash}
```

## 6. Configure Public URLs

You can skip this for local testing. Once real launchers, servers, or external users need to reach the service, configure public URLs.

For normal deployments, configure:

```text
public_site_url
```

If the Yggdrasil API is exposed under a different path or host, configure the advanced override:

```text
yggdrasil_public_base_url
```

Without a usable public URL, the service cannot build absolute texture URLs in the textures property, and skins will fail to load.

## 7. Local Docs Site

```bash
cd docs
bun install
bun run docs:dev
```

Build docs:

```bash
cd docs
bun run docs:build
```
